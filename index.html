        <li>
          Once we have the program, the first thing we will do is select it.
        </li>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/01.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
        <li>
          After having done that, it opens the options tab in which we must
          select "Open / Abrir".
        </li>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/02.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
        <li>
          Once the above is done, the installation process will begin and as the
          first part, we have to select the language we want.
        </li>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/03.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
        <li>
          The next step is to choose the path of the program, in this step we
          must select the location in which the data and files of the program
          will be housed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/04.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
        <li>
          Once the location path has been chosen, the next thing is to select
          the additional tasks that we would like the installation program to
          perform and then click on next.
        </li>
        <br />
        <img src="./img/05.png" alt="" /><br /><br />
        <li>
          Once all the necessary steps have been carried out, they ask us if we
          are ready to install the program on the computer, we will select
          “Install” to begin the installation or you can select “Back” if you
          want to make a configuration change.
        </li>
        <br />

        <span
          >Using the Periodic Table program is very easy, just select the
          element you want and the upper screen of the table will show us a
          window with the information about the selected element such as its
          symbol, name, atomic number, atomic mass, electronic configuration,
          electronegativity and year of discovery and an image referring to the
          element. If you want to close the program just click on the "x"
          button, found in the upper corner of the window and click on the "-"
          button if you want to minimize the window.</span
